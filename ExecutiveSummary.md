##Executive Summary


With open source software becoming increasingly important in software development, a system that is able to scan all software packages becomes neccessary for an organization. Most software packages used today can have multiple licenses attached and it is important for a company to know what they are using in order to give proper recognition to the devlopers and avoid license troubles.

The system is will first scan the software package provided from the developer. After all of the packages are scanned, the system is able to store the software components so they can later be accessed by a developer or manager. To ensure all licenses and vulnerabilities are acceptable, the developer and/or manager provide the scanned results to be compared to the corporate policy. All edits and additions to corporate policy are handled by the manager of the organization.
