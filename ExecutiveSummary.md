Executive Summary

(You need a paragraph here to explain WHY we need such a system. THis could include such things as developers engaging with open source at increasing rates, the reality that open source has become increasingly important in software development, ...). You need to work this motivation out a bit more. 

(This is really the second, functional paragraph)
The system is used in order to scan all software packages used by the company. After all of the packages are scanned, the system is able to
store the software components so they can later be accessed by a developer or manager. To ensure all licenses and vulnerabilities are acceptable,
the developer and/or manager provide the scanned results to be compared to the corporate policy. All edits and additions to corporate policy are handled by the manager of
he organization.
