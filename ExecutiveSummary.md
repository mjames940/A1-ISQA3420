Executive Summary

(You need a paragraph here to explain WHY we need such a system. THis could include such things as developers engaging with open source at increasing rates, the reality that open source has become increasingly important in software development, ...). You need to work this motivation out a bit more. 

With open source software becoming increasingly important in software development, a system that is able to scan all software packages becomes neccessary for an organization. Most software packages used today can have multiple licenses attached and it is important for a comapny to know what they are using in order to give proper recognition to the devlopers and avoid license troubles.

The system is used in order to scan all software packages used by the company. After all of the packages are scanned, the system is able to store the software components so they can later be accessed by a developer or manager. To ensure all licenses and vulnerabilities are acceptable, the developer and/or manager provide the scanned results to be compared to the corporate policy. All edits and additions to corporate policy are handled by the manager of the organization.
